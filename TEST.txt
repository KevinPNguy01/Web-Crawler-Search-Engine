Initially, queries that were longer, such as "master of software engineering" or 
"university of california irvine computer science ranking," took a significant amount
of time to process because of two factors: how we processed the tokens and how we accessed
the information.

For each token in the query, our program finds all the postings related to that token. 
However, since our index was stored in one entire file, this made it inefficient.


To improve on this, we've implemented an index_of_index which maps tokens to the file position, 
significantly increasing our performance.


Furthermore, another issue we dealt with was certain queries where some of the postings we received 
were large in size compared to other web pages. With how our program worked, after the query was
dispatched and we found the related webpage, we would have to open up the webpage for the title,
URL, and text summary, slowing down performance. To combat this, we've stored the URL, title, and 
file path in the crawled.txt file for a more efficient process during runtime.
